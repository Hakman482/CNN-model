# AI for induction motor fault classification
These models were built as part of my undergraduate final year research project work. I built three deep learning models on 3 pretrained models: VGG19, ResNet152 and InceptionV3 using transfer learninig, for the detection and classification of three-phase induction motor stator faults. 

After retraining the various bases on processed fault signals generated from the simulation of an induction motor, and analyising the model outcomes based on accuracy, precision, F-1 and recall score metrics, the ResNet152 performed best. This model has the best suitable architecture that captures the underlying patterns in the data effectively.
